This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
My name is Christy Burton, I am currently a Business Systems Analyst. I have been with my current employer for 20 years and worn many hats. I worked in the IT QA department for 6 years and loved it so much. I had a mentor who taught me a little about coding, how Git works and we even did the Hello World exercise. I also learn a lot about coding through my QA testing days. I am still heavily involved in the QA/Engineering world in my current role and am looking forward to learning more to continue growing my skill set.
